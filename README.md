I am glad to share my first python script ,

The Idea behind this script is simple but efficiency in saving time  , because of the requirement to build a database in preparation for migration

 

Concept : importing a csv file generated by Mostafa script with full network data ( services names with its OTS ,, and protection details , â€¦.. ) , and proceeding it using Python data frames  ( attachment : SNC-SharedRisk-Report & NetServ-Ed1.4.py )

 

Output: is a multiple xlsx files each named as site naming  , and internally have a multiple sheets each per rate , and each sheet have only data relate to this service rate , and of course some styles added to make  it easy for reading ( Sample of Output attached : XC-report-CEN_BES.xlsx & XC-report-DFA_EMH.xlsx  )

 

Value : saving time , as preparing such sheets for this required sites ( 50 sites * 11 rates ) = ~ 500 sheets which might takes around one month of Dummy working  , but building such a script takes only 10 days ( form beginner like me ), And the process is now fully automated (which save us from last min customer changing data )
